        <b>Date :</b> Sep 27, 2021<br />
        <b>Cause :</b> A cyclone flooded parts of India's eastern coast with heavy rains and uprooted thousands of
        trees and power poles, knocking out electricity, before weakening to a deep depression Monday.<br />
        <b>Response :</b> Authorities in two coastal states had been on high alert as the cyclone with sustained winds
        blowing up to 85 kilometers per hour (53 mph) hit the eastern seaboard late Sunday evening. National Disaster
        Response Force teams were deployed to the eastern state of Odisha and the southern state of Andhra Pradesh,
        where thousands of people were evacuated.<br />
        <b>Damage :</b>Heavy rains lashed the town of Kalingapatnam in Andhra Pradesh state on Sunday, swamping roads
        and marooning hundreds of villages. One fisherman was missing and another was injured when their boat was hit by
        the high tide, but no deaths have been reported from the storm.<br />
